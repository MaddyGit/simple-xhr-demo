# simple-xhr-demo
Simple app to use some client/server xhr
simple client-side xhr using JavaScript fetch api
simple server-side xhr using file_get_contents php function

this app will work if you clone this repository in your local apache server's Document Root under directory named 'echosome' and access it in your browser like http://yourlocalhost/echosome (for me it's http://localhost/echosome)
